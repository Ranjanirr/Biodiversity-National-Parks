# Biodiversity-National-Parks

-The data folder contains two sets of data - observations, which contains species observation statistics and species, which contains more informaiton about each species. Given this data, I combined it and I wanted to use this data to find answers on which parks contian the most endangered species, and which types of species tend to be most at risk. This analysis was done mostly using bar and pie charts. 


## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents

- `biodiversity.ipynb` - Main Jupyter Notebook with code and analysis.
- `data/` - observations.csv, species_info.csv from the website https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nationalparkservice/park-biodiversity
- observations contains the scientific name, location, and the number of observations of that species
- -species info contains other information like common name, species family and conservation status
- `README.md` - This file with instructions on how to view the notebook properly.


## Main Insights

From the pie charts - The second pie chart (species type count by endangerment level) has a larger ratio of endangered/threatened species than the first pie chart (total observation count categorised by endangerment level). There are many types of endangered/threatened species observed in all the parks, but fewer quantities observed for them.

From bar chart - The proportions of rare species to total species is the same for all national parks, meaning that there are no parks that need more attention than others

From the family pie chart - Birds and mammals comprise the most ENDANGERED observations, conservation strategies for these families need to be looked at carefully
