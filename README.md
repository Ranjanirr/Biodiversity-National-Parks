# Biodiversity-National-Parks

This analyzes the types and numbers of endangered species in various national parks in the United States. Details include 
  - Stacked bar chart, displaying the amount and types of rare species observations per national park
  - Pie chart, grouping species by conservation status
  - Pie chart, amount of observations by category in for all species vs rare species
  - List of 5 most endangered species

## Main Insights

From the pie charts - The second pie chart (species type count by endangerment level) has a larger ratio of endangered/threatened species than the first pie chart (total observation count categorised by endangerment level). There are many types of endangered/threatened species observed in all the parks, but fewer quantities observed for them.

From bar chart - The proportions of rare species to total species is the same for all national parks, meaning that there are no parks that need more attention than others

From the family pie chart - Birds and mammals comprise the most ENDANGERED observations, conservation strategies for these families need to be looked at carefully
